- Initialized workspace identity as Senti 🛰️ and logged ignismeow’s preferences (focus on Solana AI Agent hackathon, Most Agentic prize goal).
- Installed Solana CLI 1.18.17 manually, configured to devnet, and bootstrapped Node.js v22.3.0 plus npm to support Solana Agent Kit tooling.
- Added solana-agent-kit dependency, wrote a verification script (scripts/verify-agent-kit.js) that instantiates the kit and successfully queries devnet metadata.
- Awaiting AgentWallet connection details; ignismeow asked to connect AgentWallet using your-email@example.com for compliance treasury wallet setup.
